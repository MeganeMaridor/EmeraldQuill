## Ingredients

* 400g of salt cod
* 300g of all-purpose flour
* 250ml of milk
* 1 tsp of baking soda
* 2 scallions, chopped
* 3 garlic cloves
* ½ bunch of flat parsley, very finely chopped
* 1 West Indian pepper, chopped
* Juice of 1 lime
* ½ tsp of salt
* ½ tsp of pepper
* Peanut oil (for frying)

## Method

### Desalting the cod

1. Cut the cod into chunks and put them in a colander.
2. Immerse the colander into a large container filled with water and put it in the refrigerator.
3. Leave it for 24 hours, changing the water as often as possible.

### Accras

1. Cut the cod and add to a saucepan with one garlic clove. Cover with water. Bring to a boil.
2. In a bowl, crumble cod finely, and remove bones if any.
3. Chop the 2 raw garlic cloves and the blanched garlic clove.
4. Mix cod, garlic, chives, peppers and parsley.
5. In a large bowl, pour the flour. Make a well and pour half of the milk in the center.
6. Mix gently and then slowly pour the remaining milk until reaching a semi thick batter of the same density as heavy cream.
7. If the batter seems too liquid, add a little flour. If it is too thick, thin with a little water.
8. Incorporate the cod mixture to the batter.
9. In a bowl, put baking soda and pour the lemon juice over it. It will emulsify. Incorporate into the batter immediately so it rises.
10. Let the dough rest for 1 hour in the refrigerator.
11. In a skillet, heat a large oil bath.
12. Pour batter with a spoon to form small fritters or form balls with well oiled hands.
13. When the fritters are golden, remove them with a slotted spoon and let them drain 2 to 3 minutes on paper towels.
14. Serve the fritters warm.
15. Salt cod fritters will keep 48 hours in the refrigerator in an airtight container.
