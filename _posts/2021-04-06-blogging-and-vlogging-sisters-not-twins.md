Blogging has been around for many years, and is a good way for people to talk about topics they're passionate about, and share that passion with others online. However, the growth of video platforms such as YouTube has seen the emergence of another form of blogging: vlogging. While it can be argued that they are, in essence, the same thing, (mostly because the topics are usually the same) this article will show that blogging and vlogging have differences that make them sisters, not twins.

One of the main differences is content creation. In a blog, the main source of content is writing, while in a vlog, you may need to shoot original clips, which can go from filming yourself in your bedroom, to filming your skiing or scuba-diving trips (although these are made way more difficult due to the pandemic we're currently facing). This difference also impacts the editing process, which is more often than not way more complex for vlogs. Indeed, while proofreading a blog can be quite easy, editing videos can prove to be quite challenging.

Another main difference is the equipment needed. Anyone can argue that while you basically only need a computer (or even just a phone!) and an internet connection to blog, vlogging requires you to have a video editing software, but also a good camera, a good microphone, and maybe even lightning devices.

The audience may also not be the same, with a younger audience (such as teenagers) preferring videos which are, well, more visual than a blog post. It can also be argued that, in the digital age, vlogging may be more popular than blogging, and that therefore your content is likely to be viewed by more people if it takes the form of a vlog.

Both blogging and vlogging have pros and cons. As said before, blogging is way less expensive than vlogging, and there are websites/social media platforms such as Tumblr that allow you to create your blog for free and without needing to know about web development. However, blogging is slowly losing popularity because of YouTube, and it may be hard to keep up to date with Search Engine Optimisation (which allows for your content to be on top of the results in a search engine). As for, vlogging, it does allow to reach your audience more easily, and there are new ideas emerging everyday with challenges and other trends. It may also be easier to keep your audience engaged with a video than a text (especially for teens, as said above). However, vlogs can be more intimidating to create, because it does require you to sit in front of a camera, which can cause anxiety and therefore is not for everyone. It also requires more equipment and knowledge around editing videos.

 

            At the end of the day, both are very similar, and whether you choose to start a blog or a vlog depends entirely on what you're most comfortable with.
